# FizzBuzz
My take on the fizz buzz algorithm


oop.php contains classes for executing the FizzBuzz algorithm (see below) using an object oriented pattern.

Your goal is to write an application that uses the FizzBuzz algorithm. The application will take a starting number and an ending number, both specified as `0 < number <= 100`.

The application will return numbers divisible by 3 as Fizz. Numbers divisible by 5 will return as Buzz. Finally, numbers divisible by 15 will return as FizzBuzz.

Examples:
```
1 == "1"
5 == "Buzz"
6 == "Fizz"
8 == "8"
15 == 'FizzBuzz'
